Creating a colormap from a list of colors
-----------------------------------------
Creating a colormap from a list of colors can be done with the `from_list`
method of `LinearSegmentedColormap`. You must pass a list of RGB tuples that
define the mixture of colors from 0 to 1.


Creating custom colormaps
-------------------------
It is also possible to create a custom mapping for a colormap. This is
accomplished by creating dictionary that specifies how the RGB channels
change from one end of the cmap to the other.

Example: suppose you want red to increase from 0 to 1 over the bottom
half, green to do the same over the middle half, and blue over the top
half.  Then you would use:

cdict = {'red':   ((0.0,  0.0, 0.0),
                   (0.5,  1.0, 1.0),
                   (1.0,  1.0, 1.0)),

         'green': ((0.0,  0.0, 0.0),
                   (0.25, 0.0, 0.0),
                   (0.75, 1.0, 1.0),
                   (1.0,  1.0, 1.0)),

         'blue':  ((0.0,  0.0, 0.0),
                   (0.5,  0.0, 0.0),
                   (1.0,  1.0, 1.0))}

If, as in this example, there are no discontinuities in the r, g, and b
components, then it is quite simple: the second and third element of
each tuple, above, is the same--call it "y".  The first element ("x")
defines interpolation intervals over the full range of 0 to 1, and it
must span that whole range.  In other words, the values of x divide the
0-to-1 range into a set of segments, and y gives the end-point color
values for each segment.

Now consider the green. cdict['green'] is saying that for
0 <= x <= 0.25, y is zero; no green.
0.25 < x <= 0.75, y varies linearly from 0 to 1.
x > 0.75, y remains at 1, full green.

If there are discontinuities, then it is a little more complicated.
Label the 3 elements in each row in the cdict entry for a given color as
(x, y0, y1).  Then for values of x between x[i] and x[i+1] the color
value is interpolated between y1[i] and y0[i+1].

Going back to the cookbook example, look at cdict['red']; because y0 !=
y1, it is saying that for x from 0 to 0.5, red increases from 0 to 1,
but then it jumps down, so that for x from 0.5 to 1, red increases from
0.7 to 1.  Green ramps from 0 to 1 as x goes from 0 to 0.5, then jumps
back to 0, and ramps back to 1 as x goes from 0.5 to 1.

row i:   x  y0  y1
                /
               /
row i+1: x  y0  y1

Above is an attempt to show that for x in the range x[i] to x[i+1], the
interpolation is between y1[i] and y0[i+1].  So, y0[0] and y1[-1] are
never used.
