A 6 DOF Parallel 
Kinematic
Mechanism (6D PKM)
Robot for Stereotactic Neurosurgery
The  phantom  based  trial  runs  are  conducted  to  demonstrate  high  precision  feature  of  the  6D
-
PKM.  The 
accuracy
of  the  robot  is  100  microns.  Many  aspects  of  design,  visualization  and 
features are considered for a successful stereotactic neurosurgical procedure. 
This  research  project  is  developed  by  Division  of  Remote  Handling  &  Robotics  and  Computer 
Division, BAR
